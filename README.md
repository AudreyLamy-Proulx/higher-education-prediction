# Higher Education Prediction

## Project Overview
This project analyzes demographic and academic data from Portuguese secondary school students to identify factors associated with their intention to pursue higher education.  
The analysis involves data cleaning, exploratory visualization, and a logistic regression model to examine the relationships between student characteristics and their post-secondary education plans.

## Dataset
The dataset used is a modified version of the **Student Performance Data Set** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:  
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance. 

- **Source:** Paulo Cortez and Alice Silva, University of Minho, Portugal (2008)
- **Data:** Collected during the 2005â€“2006 school year from two Portuguese secondary schools
- **Attributes:** Demographic, social, and academic features, as well as grades and study habits

## Project Steps
1. **Import Libraries and Data**  
2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Remove missing or implausible values  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**  
   - Distribution plots grouped by the intention to pursue higher education  
   - Summary statistics  
4. **Feature Relationship Checks**  
   - Multicollinearity analysis  
5. **Modeling**  
   - Logistic regression to predict post-secondary education intention  
6. **Results and Observations**
